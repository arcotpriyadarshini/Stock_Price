Stock Market Prediction Using Time Series Analysis.

This project aims to predict stock prices of major companies like Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Tesla using sentiment analysis of Twitter data. Apple was chosen due to its large data sample. Tweets were analyzed for polarity (positive, negative, neutral) and subjectivity to identify a correlation between public sentiment and stock price movements. Using this correlation, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models were developed to forecast next-day stock values (open, close, high, low) based on sentiment scores and daily stock data. The model achieved strong results, particularly with Apple, showing prediction errors of less than 5%. This approach holds promise for aiding business and investment decisions.
